# Portfolio synchronization — 2026-10-22

By Jason Stys. Source baseline: `ede33c7979e8916d8cf5a437b85c373c6e565619`.

Reviewed original proposals: [#11](https://github.com/JasonStys/industrial-memory-protocol-workbench/pull/11). Their commit ancestry is retained in a combined integration candidate; a normal merge is permitted only after that exact candidate passes applicable native workflows. No branch protection, test threshold, security scan or failing step is bypassed. Historical references and intentionally separate experiments are preserved.

Dependency manifests are reconciled as the union of proposed dependency changes, not wholesale replacement with an older branch. Overlapping locks are mechanically resolved with the registry tools. Python package constraints and the actual installed CI/runtime locks are kept consistent; Vitest/coverage providers and CodeQL steps are coordinated. Runtime/data directories are not included in Git.

Validation is commit-specific: use this repository's [Actions](https://github.com/JasonStys/industrial-memory-protocol-workbench/actions) and integration PR checks. This record describes the reviewed work, not a claim that a future revision has already passed. Default-branch checks are verified again after merge. Private full audit and Actions backups stay on the owner's PC, outside public source.
